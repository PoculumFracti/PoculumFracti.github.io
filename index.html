<p><strong>Spend at least 7 days in Kyoto.  Most attractions close before 6.  Many places with fee’d entry will have last entry at 3:30pm.  If you are planning to pay for special entrance to an area, such as the Kyoto Imperial Palace or Nijo Castle, plan on doing that first.  Some areas are honor system where you pay 300-600 yen into a box or enter at a specific gate.</strong></p>
