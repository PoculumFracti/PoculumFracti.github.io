<html><title>Japan 2025 albums</title>
  <p>For this trip the focus is on Koga.  We did spend a day in Tokyo.  </p>
<p>Originally I was going to look at fashion in Ikebukuro and technology in Akihabara, but I wanted to get to Koga fast to see friends and learn more Japanese.  </p>
<p>So far I have learned very little Japanese but am meeting very many people.</p>
