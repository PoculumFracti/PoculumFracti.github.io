<h1 id="packing">Packing</h1>
<p>Try to fit everything into a large backpack.  Then, either bring a wheely bag with the stuff that doesn&#39;t fit OR buy a wheely bag in Japan.  There&#39;s thousands of options they love wheely bags.</p>
<h2 id="you-must-be-able-to-carry-everything">You must be able to carry everything</h2>
<p>You will be walking up and down stairs.  Do not bring a bag too heavy to carry.  You can use the wheels on level ground and escalators.</p>
<h4 id="when-on-an-escalator-the-bag-should-be-on-the-step-in-front-of-you">When on an escalator, the bag should be on the step in front of you</h4>
<p>If you have a bad designed bag, then this is impossible as you cannot always push the bag forward.  </p>

<h2 id="packing-list">Packing list</h2>
<p>This is my clothes packing list from 2025:</p>

<li>Four t-shirts</li>
<li>Two button up dress shirts</li>
<li>Two pairs of pants</li>
<li>4 sets of underpants and socks</li>
<li>One zipper hoody</li>
<li>One zipper fleece for layering</li>
<li>One full hoody</li>
<li>2 pairs of pajama pants (one for yoga)</li>

<ul>
<li>Deodorant</li>
<li>Toothbrush and toothpaste</li>
<li>Small towel you will carry always</li>
<li>ONE charging cable of each type needed</li>
<li>#CHOCOLATE &gt; There is no chocolate in Japan.  Don&#39;t buy Japanese &quot;Chocolate&quot;</li>
<li>More chocolate for gifts</li>
<li>Chocolate.</li>
<li>Nuts make a surprisingly good gift</li>
<li>More gifts (see [[#Gifts]])</li>
<li>One book or kindle</li>
<li>Sketchbook or journal (must be large enough for stamps maximum around 4x4 inches most 3 1/4&quot;)</li>
<li>Binder like those leather holders or paper holder (can be bought in Japan although the binders in Japan are not actually great for travel)</li>
<li>I brought a laptop for work, unnecessary for most people.  Nice for researching but that can be done on a phone.

You will probably get hot in the day by walking unless it is winter time or you are on a mountain.  Layering is effective but many people get by with a nice jacket. </li>
</ul>
<p>Check the average temperatures for your visiting areas.</p>
<h2 id="the-sun">The Sun</h2>
<p>Is not that bad, surprisingly.  I do get burned but I am out there for hours at a time.</p>
<h2 id="it-will-rain">It will rain</h2>
<p>And you will get wet.  That&#39;s the way it is.</p>
<h2 id="shoes">Shoes</h2>
<p>They will become destroyed.  Bring your most comfortable for walking hours and hours each day.  I wear front striking wide toe-box running shoes from China because they match my gait.  I bring an emergency backup slip on for when the inevitable rain drenches my shoes.</p>
<h2 id="socks">Socks</h2>
<p>Get socks you can wash in a sink with hand soap and hang to dry overnight.  </p>
<h2 id="the-towel-drying-trick">The towel drying trick</h2>
<p>Wring your clothes out after washing, then lay them flat on a clean dry towel.  Roll the towel tightly up with the clothing and then twist it.  The towel will absorb most of the moisture even to the point where you can wring the towel out after. </p>
<p>Hang the items to dry after.</p>
<p>Nothing.  NOTHING will ever fully dry in Japan.  That&#39;s just the way it is.</p>
<h3 id="the-japanese-do-not-wear-logos-often">The Japanese do not wear logos often</h3>
<p>It is incredibly popular to wear brandless clothes, in fact, Muji&#39;s brand, a major brand, is there is no brand marking on their clothing.   They have either incredibly simple designs or plain colors.  Layering is big.  If you have &quot;style&quot; or are aware of &quot;fashion&quot; then you will fit right in.  (I don&#39;t)</p>
<p>Only wear nice clothes.  Do not wear pilling or hole&#39;d clothes.  Only nice stuff because that is respectful to others who have to look at your awkward style.  Black is the most acceptable color.</p>
<h3 id="i-wore-one-set-of-clothes-on-the-plane-">I wore one set of clothes on the plane.</h3>
<p>We washed clothes every 4-5 days.  If I could repack again I would bring more underpants and I might be able to survive with just one pair of pants but it just feels risky.</p>
<p>The hoody abundance was because it was 40 degrees and there was no central heating in the house.  It became 40 degrees INSIDE at night so I would have to wear many layers.  While I was in Japan I followed the plan and bought new shirts, an overcoat, a winter coat, and a vest to replace other clothes.  I threw out the zipper hoody and full hoody since they were at the end of their life span.  I took home more clothes than I brought.</p>
<p>When I went in the spring I could have brought half the clothing (just more shirts because I was sweating through them)</p>
<h3 id="japan-has-good-clothing">Japan has good clothing</h3>
<p>...and it might be a good idea to plan on buying some there.  Pay good money and get great clothes that will last.</p>
<p>Uniqlo has great variety, but you will have to go to more than one location to find what you want.  There are also overstock malls that have KILLER deals.  I bought A LOT every time we stepped foot in them.  They have the stuff that did not finish selling or did not sell well.  Great for me, a 6&#39;3&quot; American.  That is where I was able to get long sleeved items.</p>
<p>If you are more average size, you will have an easy time finding great clothes at very affordable prices.  Be aware of the uber fashion stores that sell imported &quot;street&quot; clothing at horrendous markup, although occasionally you will find an outlet with incredibly cheap &quot;used&quot; clothing that looks like it has never been worn.</p>
<h1 id="on-items">On Items</h1>
<h2 id="wallet">Wallet</h2>
<p>You need a wallet that can handle the Yen bill, which is longer and wider than an American bill, and yen coins.  I used one for each for a long time until I found something at the dollar store that could handle both.
Most people use a envelope style wallet that keeps the bills nice and straight.  I ain&#39;t got no time fo dat.  I fold my bills.  Don&#39;t crumple them.
see [[#Office Supplies]]</p>
<h2 id="office-supplies">Office Supplies</h2>
<p>Hit up a Daiso and Seria and Muji immediately after you park your luggage.  There is a plethora of tiny zipper packages, wallets, folders, notebooks and so on.  Canvas is a really good notebook brand but the paper might be too smooth for some people.  Pens are everywhere.  I like Muji Gel pens because they do not smear and I am left handed.
Folders are everywhere and super nice decorative ones can be found in museum and gift shops.</p>
<p>I always get tons of zipper packages.  Mountains of them.</p>
<h2 id="deodorant">Deodorant</h2>
<p>You can buy MOST things in Japan except deodorant.  They have the same crap everyone else has that doesn&#39;t work or stains your clothes but nothing decent.  </p>
<h2 id="small-towel">Small Towel</h2>
<p>You can buy a small towel in Japan for cheap but it&#39;s best to pick one out before you go.  The sizes in Japan are very strange and the towel you end up having to buy will either be twice as long or half as wide as you need.  I recommend an absorbent one. </p>
<ul>
<li>My towel is 24&quot;x15&quot;.  It could be smaller but this one lays nicely on my lap while I am eating and folds up easily to fit in my back pocket<h4 id="you-need-a-towel">You need a towel</h4>
There are often no towels in the bathrooms so if you wash your hands or face you will not have anything other than your clothes to dry off.  Also, you will be eating a lot of soup.<h2 id="no-need-to-overpack">No need to overpack</h2>
There is plenty of things to buy<h2 id="do-not-bring-a-water-bottle">Do not bring a water bottle</h2>
You will most likely not need one unless you go in May-August and even then you will probably opt for filling a vending machine bottle
You do not need a water bottle because you will only need it maybe twice when you can just get a drink from a vending machine that is 5 feet away.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gifts">Gifts</h1>
<p>PRE-PACKAGED.  Do not give baggies of stuff.  Gifts need to be FINISHED PRODUCT.  I&#39;m yelling because it&#39;s IMPORTANT.  Do not give someone a half bar of chocolate.  Give them a whole bar.  They don&#39;t need Hershey&#39;s, BTW.  Lindt, Ghiradeli, or good stuff.  </p>
<p>They have great coffee.  Unless you can get some radically good stuff, they do not need your coffee.  They need chocolate.</p>
<p>Japanese love food.  When you are stopping to visit someone you MUST bring a package of something.  Every train station has a gift shop.  At minimum, buy a nice snack from the gift shop.  They will most likely share it with you.  Two things is okay but I would not get more than one per person + 1 you are visiting.</p>
