<h1 id="hotels-ryokans-hostels">Hotels, Ryokans, Hostels</h1>
<p>Stays can be gotten same day often quite easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Love hotels usually require Male and Female guest but can be gotten for short stays or over night.  <ul>
<li>Some do not let you leave once you check in so do not automatically think you can put your stuff in and walk around town after</li>
<li>Old and stinky</li>
<li>usually cannot stay more than one night at a time.</li>
<li>Great for temporary nap, like a few hours midday</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Booking.com and Agoda.com are great for last minute hotels. Agoda usually has cheapest price but is very inflexible if there is a problem.  If you can speak Japanese it can be negotiated over phone, however, if you can you should reserve with the hotel directly because often that has the best price.</li>
<li>AZ hotel is very popular and usually very clean.  they charge PER PERSON so for two people expect about 80 dollars a night.</li>
<li>DEALS!  Hotels have deals for long stays.  Have to go to the hotel website to find these out.</li>
<li>Hostels are plentiful.  They are full of white people who will not talk to you.  They are also full of non-white people who will.  These come in many forms<ul>
<li>BUNK &gt; shared army barrocks style bedding = Cheapest</li>
<li>small room or double &gt; check pictures.  Some rooms are the size of one queen size mattress.  Some are very large.  </li>
<li>Sometimes industrial style with cement floors</li>
<li>Almost always a shared bathroom.</li>
<li>Website usually has best price, and if you are a returning guest you can get an even cheaper deal through suave negotiation tactics.<h4 id="ryokans">Ryokans</h4>
Ryokans are bed and breakfast but there is no bed and often no breakfast.  The food is usually only on specific days of the week and the price of said food will be included in THAT DAY&#39;s rent.  The anticipation MAY be that you DO NOT LEAVE during your stay or only leave for a little time and return for meal time and leisure time SOMETIMES WITH THE OWNER OR HELPER.
Do not be alarmed, because this is usually made clear in the booking.
No bed means you will sleep on a mat on the floor.
Ryokan websites exist and usually offer the best prices, however, most ryokan&#39;s are small and have limited rooms so reserving ahead of time might be necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="phone-">PHONE:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Download Mobimatter</li>
<li>select japan</li>
<li>My recommendation is 30 days 15 gigabytes from NTT Docomo</li>
<li>You can select plan and scroll down to see Network.  NTT Docomo has the best coverage usually.   </li>
<li>Activated it before you get on the plane to go to japan and you will land with service.</li>
<li>Or wait until you land and goof around with it.</li>
<li>Get GOOGLE VOICE and set up a number ASAP.  Use this number to make international calls.</li>
<li>You will not be using text or phone calling for Japanese things unless you buy a japanese phone number, which is fun but only good for taxi cabs and winning the trust of foreigners.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apps-">APPS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI Aps: ChatGPT, Google Translate, Papago, DeepL<ul>
<li>Google Translate is simple and straight forward.  Conversations option is super easy to use.  Getting Japanese people to speak slowly is impossible, though (because it messes up their cadence).</li>
<li>ChatGPT can help you understand something</li>
<li>Papago and DeepL sometimes understand context easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Lens (google if on apple) MUST HAVE.</li>
<li>Kanji Graph (for drawing kanji and identifying them)</li>
<li>GOOGLE MAPS (the dominant map software.  others exist but google maps dominates)</li>
<li>LINE app : Messaging app used for many things in Japan.  Currently there exists the option to register from USA, but this is new.</li>
<li>Google Japanese Keyboard (or apple equivalent)</li>
<li>NaviLens (museums might use it)</li>
<li>smartEX app : for getting shinkansen tickets.  can use website but app is a little easier on phone.  Register right away for use.  See transportation section for how to order ticket.</li>
<li>Make sure your email is working on your phone. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-to-do-after-landing-read-now">What to do after landing: READ NOW</h1>
<h4 id="passing-customs">Passing Customs</h4>
<p>Don&#39;t bring drugs.  If you bring Ibeuprofin, get those individual packs that have two pills per pack.  If you have prescriptions bring them WITH THE PRESCRIPTION
Do not brink stimulants or performance enhancing drugs.</p>
<h5 id="the-customs-forms">The Customs forms</h5>
<p>You fill this out ONLINE before you come.  You will need to fill in the hotel information as well.  There is a TON of screens you need to use.</p>
<h4 id="do-this-now">DO THIS NOW</h4>
<p><a href="https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/">https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/</a>
FOR EACH PASSENGER.  FILL IT OUT UNTIL YOU GET THE CONFIRMATION.  IF YOU ARE WITHIN THE TIME WINDOW IT WILL GENERATE A QR CODE FOR YOU AND YOU WILL SCAN IT RIGHT BEFORE SPEAKING TO CUSTOMS.  YOU MUST DO THIS OR FILL OUT A CRUMBY PAPER IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE.  there is an ap you can get if you like.</p>
<h4 id="landing">Landing</h4>
<p>If you are landing at Haneda, watch this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2cWxicoqLU0?si=5CwFJmemNJz_5zCK">https://youtu.be/2cWxicoqLU0?si=5CwFJmemNJz_5zCK</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Then watch more.  It is important to not get disoriented.  You will be landing at Terminal 3 and will take the City Monorail car to Toyko Station.  It is some number of stops.  DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF THE DAY you might get off and ride local trains part way to Tokyo station.</li>
<li>After you go through customs you will get your bags then you get to talk to<h4 id="claims">Claims</h4>
If you are claiming anything you have to <strong>fill out a form</strong> and talk to another customs agent.  Otherwise you just answer some questions.  It&#39;s not too hard to figure out but you will probably have to ask for help.  This is probably the most stress you will have unless you get stressed about the trains which you will not if you read my section on transportation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="transportation">Transportation</h1>
<p>Cars drive on the Left side of the road. </p>
<ul>
<li>In Tokyo people will not avoid you</li>
<li>In Kyoto they will actively walk into you</li>
<li>In Fukuoka they will stop and move off to the side and then hand you a gift as you pass
Transportation is in the following types<h4 id="walking">Walking</h4>
By far the best and most fun<h4 id="bicycle-or-rent-a-scooter">Bicycle or Rent a scooter</h4>
If you are staying in Kyoto for several days, consider renting a bicycle. DO NOT do this the first day you land because you will crash into people.  <h4 id="car">Car</h4>
You can rent a car IF you apply for an international license.  This can be done easily and quickly in most USA states.  I do not recommend driving your first time in a left side of the road country. <h4 id="taxi">Taxi</h4>
You cannot call for a taxi without a Japanese phone number.  You can hail a taxi.  They are expensive but absolutely worth it.  Remember, no tipping.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trains">Trains</h4>
<p>Trains are split into several categories</p>
<ul>
<li>Local</li>
<li>Subway</li>
<li>Rapid - less stops</li>
<li>Limited (or special) - Requires separate ticket</li>
<li>Shinkansen - Requires separate ticket
Local makes stops at every station.<br>Subway is sometimes not any different at all from local and sometimes the same train will go to both above ground and subway stations making their difference very questionable.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] You can identify what type of train it is by the name or writing on the train itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trains descriptions will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the LINE (rail system)</li>
<li>Name of the TERMINATING STATION</li>
<li>Identifying NUMBER</li>
<li>STYLE of train
So it may appear as : 
Keihin-Tōhoku Line Local Omiya 10</li>
<li>Keihin-Tonoku Line - The rail system</li>
<li>Local - Stops every station</li>
<li>Omiya - Goes to Omiya</li>
<li>10 - Identifying number
Multiple lines can go to the same station
Google Maps might show the platform but always check the marquee boards at the stations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="special-trains">Special Trains</h2>
<h5 id="limited">Limited</h5>
<p>Limited Express costs extra money and sometimes does not get you there faster.  They are luxary rides but are sometimes the <strong>only option</strong> to get between certain cities.  The cost is high but sometimes results in a nice ride.  Some of them are very fast.</p>
<h5 id="shinkansen">Shinkansen</h5>
<p>The rail systems in Japan are mostly privately owned by JR companies.  There are many.  JR EAST is usually the only one most tourists will interact with unless you go West of Kyoto.  Each JR company has different passes but you can get the JR Rail Pass which does 90% of trains.</p>
<p>You can order a Shinkansen on the smartEX ap, online, at the station kiosk, or at a service desk.  NOT ALL SERVICE DESKS are for all JR.  If you are at a station that services multiple JR companies you will have to go to THAT JR DESK to use their services.</p>
<h4 id="each-limited-and-each-shinkansen">Each LIMITED and each SHINKANSEN</h4>
<p>will require a separate ticket.  If you are taking a trip that involves transfers you will get a ticket for each train (unless you are using a pass)</p>
<h5 id="reserved-means-you-pick-your-seat-non-reserved-means-you-might-have-to-stand">Reserved means you pick your seat, non-Reserved means you might have to stand</h5>
<p>Usually, non-Reserved is okay, but be aware you might have to stand or wait for the next train.  Most Limited and Shinkansen only have 1 or 2 cars &quot;Open&quot; for &quot;Free&quot; or non-reserved seating.  The concierge may refer to it as &quot;open&quot; seating.  Non-reserved is cheaper but you may not have a seat.  There is no charge if you have to wait for the next train.</p>
<h5 id="some-limited-do-not-have-any-open-cars-and-are-reservation-only">SOME LIMITED DO NOT HAVE ANY OPEN CARS AND ARE RESERVATION ONLY</h5>
<h2 id="how-to-navigate">How to navigate</h2>
<p>Download a lot of maps.  Take pictures of maps (best ones are ON the trains)</p>
<ul>
<li>The subway maps are, in my opinion, similar to Boston T style maps.</li>
<li>Use GOOGLE MAPS to select your route.  Get VERY familiar with its eccentricities.<ul>
<li>Select where you are going, then you have to select the route.  SOMETIMES you will have ANOTHER selection after this to tell you which train to take.</li>
<li>Google maps MIGHT tell you the platform but always check the marquee
It&#39;s actually pretty simple if you remember the few things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keep-your-shinkansen-receipts">Keep your shinkansen receipts</h2>
<p>You cannot get these reprinted later unless you go TO A STATION</p>
