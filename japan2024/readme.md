For cities, have hotel room booked before weekends.  Sometimes food is included with room.  Breakfast times and selections differ from city to city.

Use weekends for rest days or changing location days or visiting non-touristy areas.

June is Monsoon Season.  Wear sandals and prepare for being wet.

# Tokyo

**I recommend spending several days wandering around.  There are exciting things to see in every direction.  Zoos and other amusements are plentiful and inexpensive.  They can be visited without fear of a wasted day.  Every area has museums and good food.  Some areas are 24-hour excitement, others have daylight hours.**

Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum

Imperial Palace

Akihabara – Known for consumer tech, video games, radio communications, niche consumerism

Ueno – Old capital.  Large park, zoo, central location, Ameyoko shopping market, Tokyo National Museum

Senso-ju Temple, Taito City

Ikebukuro – Modern fashion center

# Kyoto

**Spend at least 7 days in Kyoto.  Most attractions close before 6.  Many places with fee’d entry will have last entry at 3:30pm.  If you are planning to pay for special entrance to an area, such as the Kyoto Imperial Palace or Nijo Castle, plan on doing that first.  Some areas are honor system where you pay 300-600 yen into a box or enter at a specific gate.**
